## Introduction

_Numerics.NET_ (formerly _Extreme Optimization Numerical Libraries for .NET_) is a solid foundation for your numerical computing needs on the Microsoft .NET platform, including .NET Core, on Linux, and on mobile.

Its broad base of algorithms covers a wide range of numerical techniques, including: linear algebra, numerical integration and differentiation, solving equations, optimization, curve fitting, statistical models, and much more.

The classes in _Numerics.NET_ and the relationships between them match our every-day concepts, and breaks new ground in usability for numerical software development.

We implemented the best algorithms available today to provide you with great performance on a robust, fast toolset.


## Nuget Packages

_Numerics.NET_ is available from the [Nuget Gallery](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/Numerics.NET).

The main packages are as follows:

- `Numerics.NET` is all you need to get started. It contains only cross-platform, managed code.
- `Numerics.NET.win-x64` adds the native libraries for Windows (x64). We highly recommend using this package for better performance.
- `Numerics.NET.linux-x64` adds the native libraries for Linux (x64). This package is required if you want to use the native libraries on Linux.

Our website has a [complete list of the available packages](https://numerics.net/nuget).


## Getting Started

_Numerics.NET_ is distributed as a fully functional 30 day trial version. If you wish to use the software after the trial expires, you may [purchase a license online](https://numerics.net/how-to-buy).

You can also obtain a [free 30 trial key](https://numerics.net/trial-key).

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Add the `Numerics.NET` Nuget package to your project.
 
2. In your application's launch code, add your trial key:  
     `Numerics.NET.License.Verify("<your trial key>");`
 
3. Check the documentation and start coding!

We encourage you to [contact support](mailto:support@numerics.net) if you have questions.


## Migrating from Extreme.Numerics

As of version 9, the root namespace is `Numerics.NET`. 
In addition to updating the Nuget package(s), 
you will need to update your code to use the new namespace.
You can do so in two easy steps:

1. Globally rename `Extreme.Mathematics` namespaces to `Numerics.NET`.
2. Globally rename `Extreme.*` namespaces to `Numerics.NET.*`.

In most cases, this can be done using a simple search and replace.


## Code examples

Code examples are available on our website in the form of
[QuickStart samples](https://numerics.net/quickstart/) in a variety of languages.

You can download ZIP files that contain all sample projects and data.


## Documentation

In addition to the QuickStart samples, our website also hosts [full documentation](https://numerics.net/documentation/).

This includes a user's guide as well as full API documentation.
